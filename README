## Arch USB Live builder

I am using this to build my USB live stick. You could try and build this, but I won't guarantee anything.

# Building

```sh
sudo docker build .  -t archusb
docker run --rm --name archusb --privileged -it -v $(pwd)/out:/build/out -v $(pwd)/work:/build/work --network=host archusb
```
